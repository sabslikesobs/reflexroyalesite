# Play Reflex Royale!

Reflex Royale is an offline reaction time game for any number of players! Each game takes about 15 seconds and you can play over and over again.

I made this game to pass the time with friends or break the ice with strangers. You can play with a partner, by yourself, or challenge the whole room. Just press and hold on the screen to join in!

Keep your finger down until the same shape comes back, then release it right away. The player who lifts their finger first wins! You'll lose if you lift your finger too early, or if you lift it for the wrong shape!

That's Reflex Royale -- give it a shot for just $2! I guarantee you'll have fun.
